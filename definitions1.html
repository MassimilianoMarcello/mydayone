HTML Headings: The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
Note: Only use one <h1> per page - this should represent the main heading/subject for the whole page. 
    Also, do not skip heading levels - start with <h1>, then use <h2>, and so on.

    <h1>This is my demo page (This is heading 1)</h1>
    <h2>Create a demo page to learn how to use html (This is heading 2)</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is heading 6</h6>

      The <p> tag defines a paragraph.Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each <p> element.  
     
        The <em> tag,  typically displayed in italic, is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
          A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.
     
            The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.
          Use the <i> element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element, such as:

<em> (emphasized text)
<strong> (important text)
<mark> (marked/highlighted text)
<cite> (the title of a work)
<dfn> (a definition term)

The <b> tag specifies bold text without any extra importance.
    According to the HTML5 specification, the <b> tag should be used as a LAST resort when no other tag is more appropriate. 
        The specification states that headings should be denoted with the <h1> to <h6> tags, emphasized text should be denoted with the <em> tag, 
            important text should be denoted with the <strong> tag, and marked/highlighted text should be denoted with the <mark> tag.
Tip: You can also use the following CSS to set bold text: "font-weight: bold;".

The <strong> tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.
Tip: Use the <b> tag to specify bold text without any extra importance!
    
    The <br> tag inserts a single line break.
The <br> tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.
The <br> tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.

    <p>To
        <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his
        <b>eyes</b> she eclipses and predominates the whole of her
        <strong>sex</strong>.<br> It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for <em>Irene Adler</em>. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
        reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent
        for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental
        results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler,
        of dubious and questionable memory.
